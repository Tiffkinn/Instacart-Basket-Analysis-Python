In this project, I cleaned, wrangled, and analyzed multiple large datasets using Python. Additionally, I created visuals in Python for a report to communicate key business insights to the client.

Instacart stakeholders are interested in the variety of customers in their database and their purchasing behaviors. They want to target different customers with applicable marketing campaigns to see whether they affect product sales. The analysis will inform what this strategy might look like to ensure Instacart targets the right customer profiles with the appropriate products.

## Key Questions:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <ul>
        <li>The sales team needs to know what the busiest days of the week and hours of the day are (i.e., the days and times with the most orders) in order to schedule ads at times when there are fewer orders.</li>
        <li>They also want to know whether there are particular times of the day when people spend the most money, as this might inform the type of products they advertise at these times.</li>
        <li>Instacart has a lot of products with different price tags. Marketing and sales want to use simpler price range groupings to help direct their efforts.</li>
        <li>Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others? The marketing and sales teams want to know which departments have the highest frequency of product orders.</li>
        <li>The marketing and sales teams are particularly interested in the different types of customers in their system and how their ordering behaviors differ.</li>
      </ul>

## Data and Tools:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <ul>
        <li>The analysis used a number of open-source data sets from Instacart, including a customer data set (created and included for the purpose of this project), on which you’ll apply what you’ve learned to address the project’s key questions. </li>
        <li>The data was analyzed using a relational database management system and PostgreSQL.</li>
      </ul>
